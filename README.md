# DriveLM: Using Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving

## Overview

Welcome to the DriveLM repository! This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as DriveLM and ChatGPT-4 in enhancing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles. By leveraging these advanced AI models, we aim to improve decision-making, safety, and overall efficiency in self-driving cars.

## Installation
## Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bohdanvodianyk/DriveLM.git
   cd DriveLM
  ```

## Usage
### Training the Model:
Open ```train_T5_base.ipynb``` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and follow the instructions to train the DriveLM model using T5-base.

### Running the Model:
Open ```Run-DriveLM.ipynb``` to see the main part of DriveLM and the run function. This notebook demonstrates how to use the trained model on new data.

### Evaluating the Model:
Open ```eval.ipynb``` to evaluate the performance of the DriveLM model using the provided evaluation metrics.
